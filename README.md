# Train SAM 2: Train/Fine-Tune Segment Anything 2 (Guide/code)
This repository contains tutorial code for fine-tuning/training segment anything 2.

You can find the [full toturial associate with code at this LINK](https://medium.com/@sagieppel/train-fine-tune-segment-anything-2-sam-2-in-60-lines-of-code-928dd29a63b3).
 
Notebook at 20240811_Inference_SAM_2.ipynb and 20240811_Training_SAM_2_Train.ipynb

The training script can be found in [TRAIN.py](https://github.com/sagieppel/fine-tune-train_segment_anything_2_in_60_lines_of_code/blob/main/TRAIN.py) or [TRAIN_multi_image_batch.py](https://github.com/sagieppel/fine-tune-train_segment_anything_2_in_60_lines_of_code/blob/main/TRAIN_multi_image_batch.py) and should work as is with the [LabPics 1 dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/3697452/files/LabPicsV1.zip?download=1).


Note [TRAIN.py](https://github.com/sagieppel/fine-tune-train_segment_anything_2_in_60_lines_of_code/blob/main/TRAIN.py) use single image per batch, while [TRAIN_multi_image_batch.py](https://github.com/sagieppel/fine-tune-train_segment_anything_2_in_60_lines_of_code/blob/main/TRAIN_multi_image_batch.py) use several images per batch, other then this they are the same.

The code for loading and using the fine-tuned net can be found in [TEST_Net.py](https://github.com/sagieppel/fine-tune-train_segment_anything_2_in_60_lines_of_code/blob/main/TEST_Net.py)

Other than these two files no modification was done to the SAM2 repository.

The training is done on the [LabPics 1 dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/3697452/files/LabPicsV1.zip?download=1).

# Original readme

**Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2)** is a foundation model towards solving promptable visual segmentation in images and videos. We extend SAM to video by considering images as a video with a single frame. The model design is a simple transformer architecture with streaming memory for real-time video processing. We build a model-in-the-loop data engine, which improves model and data via user interaction, to collect [**our SA-V dataset**](https://ai.meta.com/datasets/segment-anything-video), the largest video segmentation dataset to date. SAM 2 trained on our data provides strong performance across a wide range of tasks and visual domains.

## Installation

Please install SAM 2 on a GPU machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything-2.git

cd segment-anything-2; pip install -e .
```

To use the SAM 2 predictor and run the example notebooks, `jupyter` and `matplotlib` are required and can be installed by:

```bash
pip install -e ".[demo]"
```

## Getting Started

### Download Checkpoints

First, we need to download a model checkpoint. All the model checkpoints can be downloaded by running:

```bash
cd checkpoints
./download_ckpts.sh
```

or individually from:

- [sam2_hiera_tiny.pt](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything_2/072824/sam2_hiera_tiny.pt)
- [sam2_hiera_small.pt](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything_2/072824/sam2_hiera_small.pt)
- [sam2_hiera_base_plus.pt](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything_2/072824/sam2_hiera_base_plus.pt)
- [sam2_hiera_large.pt](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything_2/072824/sam2_hiera_large.pt)

Then SAM 2 can be used in a few lines as follows for image and video prediction.

### Image prediction

SAM 2 has all the capabilities of [SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) on static images, and we provide image prediction APIs that closely resemble SAM for image use cases. The `SAM2ImagePredictor` class has an easy interface for image prompting.

```python
import torch
from sam2.build_sam import build_sam2
from sam2.sam2_image_predictor import SAM2ImagePredictor

checkpoint = "./checkpoints/sam2_hiera_large.pt"
model_cfg = "sam2_hiera_l.yaml"
predictor = SAM2ImagePredictor(build_sam2(model_cfg, checkpoint))

with torch.inference_mode(), torch.autocast("cuda", dtype=torch.bfloat16):
    predictor.set_image(<your_image>)
    masks, _, _ = predictor.predict(<input_prompts>)
```

Please refer to the examples in [image_predictor_example.ipynb](./notebooks/image_predictor_example.ipynb) for static image use cases.

SAM 2 also supports automatic mask generation on images just like SAM. Please see [automatic_mask_generator_example.ipynb](./notebooks/automatic_mask_generator_example.ipynb) for automatic mask generation in images.

### Video prediction

For promptable segmentation and tracking in videos, we provide a video predictor with APIs for example to add prompts and propagate masklets throughout a video. SAM 2 supports video inference on multiple objects and uses an inference state to keep track of the interactions in each video.

```python
import torch
from sam2.build_sam import build_sam2_video_predictor

checkpoint = "./checkpoints/sam2_hiera_large.pt"
model_cfg = "sam2_hiera_l.yaml"
predictor = build_sam2_video_predictor(model_cfg, checkpoint)

with torch.inference_mode(), torch.autocast("cuda", dtype=torch.bfloat16):
    state = predictor.init_state(<your_video>)

    # add new prompts and instantly get the output on the same frame
    frame_idx, object_ids, masks = predictor.add_new_points(state, <your prompts>):

    # propagate the prompts to get masklets throughout the video
    for frame_idx, object_ids, masks in predictor.propagate_in_video(state):
        ...
```

Please refer to the examples in [video_predictor_example.ipynb](./notebooks/video_predictor_example.ipynb) for details on how to add prompts, make refinements, and track multiple objects in videos.
